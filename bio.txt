Jay is a passionate advocate for the oceans, dedicating his work in education at the Vancouver Aquarium, Richmond Nature Park and Metro Vancouver. He has spoken on the topic of environmental education at TEDx events, the Vancouver School Board Sustainability Conference, and the Richmond Earth Day Youth Summit. He brings his passion to his own education, as he currently studies Ecology, Evolution and Conservation at Simon Fraser University. Jay can be found exploring the natural world every chance that he gets. Recently, Jay completed the East Beach trail hike on Haida Gwaii, covering 90 km by foot solo over the course of five days. As a strong proponent of storytelling, Jay believes that Promenades sur lâ€™eau will tell the story about our oceans and our connections to the natural world through fashion.
