First time leading such a large group into the backcountry, with quite a few beginners. We had an exhausting yet fun time climbing up to and staying at the Elfin Lakes Hut. The hut is incredibly nice! So many bunks with very good facilities, including a large outhouse, sinks, heating and stoves. The biggest challenge was getting to the actual trailhead. Our minivan got stuck on the forest roads up to the trail. Fortunately, I packed a recovery strap into our van and we were able to be pulled out by friendly bystanders. Snow chains take absolutely forever to put on and take off, so avoid using if possible. The van didn't start after sitting overnight in the cold and required a jump to get going. Remember the jumper cables, recovery strap, chains and shovels as a minimum for forest roads in the winter. One party member lost their glasses in the snow, so we made the decision to split the group up in half so that one half kept going and the latter half caught up after searching for the missing glasses. I learnt to not make the decision to split unless absolutely necessarily, such as due to an injured party member. The split group caused unnecessary anxiety due to the uncertainty of their location and the inability to communicate effectively as a group. In the case of almost any emergency or challenge, it would be beneficial to stay and take advantage of the larger group rather than smaller party size.
